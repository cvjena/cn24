## Welcome to the CN24 GitHub repository!

CN24 is a complete semantic segmentation framework using fully convolutional networks. It supports a wide variety of
platforms (Linux, Mac OS X and Windows) and libraries (OpenCL, Intel MKL, AMD ACML...) while providing dependency-free
reference implementations. The software is developed in the [Computer Vision Group](http://www.inf-cv.uni-jena.de) at the [University of Jena](http://www.uni-jena.de).

## Why should I use CN24?
1. Designed for *pixel-wise labeling and semantic segmentation* (train and test your own networks!)
2. Suited for *various applications* in [driver assistance systems](http://hera.inf-cv.uni-jena.de:6680/pdf/Brust15:CPN.pdf), scene understanding, remote sensing, biomedical image processing and many more
3. *OpenCL support* not only suited for NVIDIA GPUs
4. High-performance implementation with *minimal dependencies* to other libraries

## Getting started
To get started, clone this repository and visit the [wiki](https://github.com/cvjena/cn24/wiki)! Installation is just a two command lines away. For an even faster introduction, check out one of these examples:

* [Urban Scene Understanding Example](https://github.com/cvjena/cn24/wiki/Urban-Scene-Understanding-Example)
* [Road Detection Example](https://github.com/cvjena/cn24/wiki/Road-Detection-Example)

The repository contains pre-trained networks for these two applications, which are ready to use.
